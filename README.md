# disaster-management

A disaster management app we built for Codeshastra 2017. 

This WebApp won the First Prize at the same.

## Features

- Remote monitoring of disaster and relief response.

- Automated suggestions of healthcare centres/police stations to triage relief from.

- SMS alerts to victims in the area with directions to the nearest relief centre.

- Monitoring of hospitals in the area.

- Hospitals can update patient information merely by sending a simple SMS in case of communications loss.

- Heatmap generation with the location of victims in the region to direct response.

- Citizens in case of a disaster can send SMS's to the authority. This SMS stream will be monitored and keyword clustering will be carried out to initiate a response. 

- Facial recognition to hand out relief. Photos of victims to be taken at the centre. Facial recognition will determine if relief has already been handed out to a particular individual at the centre.

- The families can search for their relatives by merely uploading their photos.

- Twitter Stream data analysis to coordinate response and relief.
